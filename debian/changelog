ros-eloquent-tf2-ros (0.5.12-2focal) focal; urgency=high

  * remove annoying gcc warning
    This is because the roslog macro cannot have two arguments that are
    formatting strings: we need to concatenate them first.
  * break canTransform loop only for non-tiny negative time deltas
    (At least) with Python 2 ros.Time.now() is not necessarily monotonic
    and one can experience negative time deltas (usually well below 1s)
    on real hardware under full load. This check was originally introduced
    to allow for backjumps with rosbag replays, and only there it makes sense.
    So we'll add a small duration threshold to ignore backjumps due to
    non-monotonic clocks.

  * do not short circuit waitForTransform timeout when running inside pytf. Fixes #102 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/102>
    roscpp is not initialized inside pytf which means that ros::ok is not
    valid. This was causing the timer to abort immediately.
    This breaks support for pytf with respect to early breaking out of a loop re #26 <https://github.com/ros/geometry_experimental/issues/26>.
    This is conceptually broken in pytf, and is fixed in tf2_ros python implementation.
    If you want this behavior I recommend switching to the tf2 python bindings.
