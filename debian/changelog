  * Typos.
  * Adds unit tests for TF loaded from parameter server.
    This tests both success (loading a valid TF into the param server) and
    failures (parameter does not exist, parameter contents are invalid).
  * Code linting & reorganization
    - whitespace
    - indentation
    - re-organized code to remove duplications.
    whitespace & indentation changes only.
    simplified (de-duplicated) duplicate code.
    missing a duplicate variable.
    whitespace changes only.

  * add utilities to get yaw, pitch, roll and identity transform
  * provide more conversions between types
    The previous conversion always assumed that it was converting a
    non-message type to a non-message type. Now, one, both or none
    can be a message or a non-message.
